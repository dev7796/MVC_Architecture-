pandas="Python and data analysis"

Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling. 

pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python

Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases,etc.

Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;

Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets;

Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;





Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability;

Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;

High performance merging and joining of data sets;


Python with pandas is in use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.



Series

Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.).

The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. 

Series is the datastructure for a single column of a DataFrame

s = pd.Series(data, index=index)



DataFrame

DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types or tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects.

It is generally the most commonly used pandas object. Like Series, DataFrame accepts many different kinds of input:

Dict of 1D ndarrays, lists, dicts, or Series
2-D numpy.ndarray
Structured or record ndarray
